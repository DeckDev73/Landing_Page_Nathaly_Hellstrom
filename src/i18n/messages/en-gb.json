        "description": "I am a Consumer Psychology & Storytelling Strategist based in Stockholm, passionate about crafting meaningful brand experiences through UX design, consumer psychology, and content creation. With ten years of experience in customer care and four years in UX and marketing strategy, I specialise in transforming client ideas into engaging, results-driven solutions. <br></br><br></br>My career began in the aviation industry, where I spent seven years as a flight attendant and three years as a cabin chief with Avianca Colombia. This role provided me with a profound understanding of customer service, human behaviour, and the importance of delivering outstanding user experiences. <br></br><br></br>Driven by a desire for new challenges, I relocated to Sweden six years ago, broadening my expertise in digital marketing, UX research, content strategy, and storytelling. Since 2021, I have been leading Vad händer i Sverige, a marketing and events agency, where I merge creativity with strategic thinking to build impactful digital narratives and unforgettable brand experiences. <br></br><br></br>At Vad händer i Sverige, I have had the privilege of working closely with clients to lead marketing strategies and deliver high-impact campaigns. These initiatives have not only elevated brand presence but also generated millions of euros in sales—demonstrating the power of strategic storytelling and UX in driving business success. <br></br><br></br>I am currently in my eighth semester of a Psychology degree, specialising in consumer psychology. My academic background provides me with deep insights into human behaviour, decision-making processes, and emotional triggers, which I apply strategically to UX design, marketing, and brand positioning. <br></br><br></br>Fluent in Spanish, English, and Swedish, I am able to navigate multicultural environments and build strong connections across diverse markets and industries. My passion for music, photography, and creativity is reflected in every project I undertake. <br></br><br></br>I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to innovate, create, and connect."
